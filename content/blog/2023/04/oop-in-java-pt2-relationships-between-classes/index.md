# Relationships between Classes

In general: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Inheritance

Inheritance ("is-a")

Inheritance, however makes sense to express a such a strict supertype-subtype
relationship as part of the Domain

## Aggregation

Aggregation ("has-a")

## Dependency

Dependence ("uses-a")

## Interfaces

# Composition over Inheritance

Another often referred principle is the so called "has-a relationship"
("composition over inheritance").

# Polymorphism

.....todo write paragraph about polymorphism
